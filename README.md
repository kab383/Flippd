# Flippd v1.0
The functionality of Flippd operates much like its competitors. However...
It's a real-estate platform that is built for a specific target audience: house flippers.

WHAT IT DOES: Flippd creates an online platform where each home registered for sale, is a home that is intended to be flipped.
This application does not seek to be a platform for move-in-ready homes. Primarily, it saves the user time. 
Sorting through opportunities in the real-estate market can be difficult when it is saturated with other housing opportunities, and this application does
that legwork for you. You can be rest assured that each home found on our application is an appropriate opportunity.

WHY IT'S USEFUL: If used regularly, Flippd can become a core part of a house flipper's routine. Finding the right house is a difficult, time-consuming part of the process. With this app, the user will be able to browse relevant listings regularly without other, less relevant opportunities saturating the listing feed.

HOW TO GET STARRTED: 
First thing would be to visit the URL where our application can be found, and register for an account. It will need pertinant information such as
email, username, and password. Phone number is optional, but recommended as another method of contact incase someone is interested in your listing.
Once registered you are free to post your own listings, and browse other listings for sale. Your profile will display all of your active and inactive
listings, so other users can see what you have available / what you have sold.

WHERE TO GET HELP: If a user has trouble with our application, please send all error and bug reports to our team for assistance, who also are responsible for maintaining
the project.
